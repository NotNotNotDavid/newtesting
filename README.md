# David's Personal Project

## General Overview:

This project will be planned around a board game, *Shikoku 1889*.

*Shikoku 1889* is a game comprised with heavy amounts of financial transactions, that is often annoying to handle physically.

The intended use of this application is to handle and record the cumbersome transactions that occur within the game.

It is inteded to be used on the side by people who are playing *Shikoku 1889*, making the application run simultaneously to what is occuring on the board.
